# SC2NeRF


## How to run
You can go inside the SC2Mod folder and double click on the SC2Components file. This will open directly on editor, which then yoou can use to run test. 
If it gives an error about a map not set, go to File -> Preferences and then to Test Document section. There you can define a map that will be used as
default for any tests you perform.

The more recommended way is look at the tasks.json on this repo and make a copy maybe and change the path for your install folder. You can then use vscode 
run default build task. You will still need a dummy map tho.
